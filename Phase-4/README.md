# Phase 4 – Screens & Flow Control

Built the full screen flow for the game using software interrupts and structured subroutines:
- Added an introduction screen (developer names, roll no., game title, optional loading animation)
- Added an instruction screen explaining controls, fuel, coins, and quitting flow
- Main screen stays static with “Press any key to start the game”
- ESC during gameplay triggers a centered confirmation box (“Do you want to exit?”)  
  – Y returns to the main screen  
  – N resumes smoothly
- Implemented an ending screen shown on game-end events (quit, fuel-out, or crash placeholder)
- Ending screen displays player name, roll no., coins, and exit options
- Player name input added before the instruction screen
- ESC behavior refined across all screens to follow proper confirmation flow
- Blue car spawns added with lane-randomness and interval spacing (fade-in/fade-out logic prepared)

Overall, Phase 4 established the complete UI flow and presentation backbone of the game.
