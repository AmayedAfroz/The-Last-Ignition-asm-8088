# Phase 6 – Background Music & Multitasking

Added the audio layer to the game using multitasking:
- Implemented background music as a separate process running alongside the main game loop
- Music generated by writing to the speaker port, producing a rhythmic, melodic pattern
- Game logic and audio run concurrently without interrupting each other
- Optional sound effects prepared for coins, fuel, crashes, transitions, etc. (not required, but enhances presentation)

Phase 6 completes the project by adding continuous, non-blocking audio to the gameplay experience.
