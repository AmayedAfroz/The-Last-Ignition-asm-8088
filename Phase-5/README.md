# Phase 5 – Core Gameplay Completion

This phase finalized the main gameplay loop and added the core mechanics:
- Added a movement delay timer so lane changes occur one step at a time (no rapid switching)
- Implemented collision detection with spark effect and immediate game-end flow
- Added coin collection and a live score counter displayed on-screen
- Introduced fuel mechanics:
  - Fuel decreases over time (timer-controlled)
  - Fuel can be refilled by collecting fuel icons
  - Fuel bar visualization implemented with level-based color states (green/yellow/red)
  - Game ends when fuel reaches zero, triggering the ending message screen
- Polished transitions and optional animations between screens

By Phase 5, the main game loop, mechanics, scoring, collision handling, and fuel system were all complete and integrated smoothly.
