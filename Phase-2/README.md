# Phase 2 – Animation Layer

Added the first real animation mechanics to the 8088 car game:
- Player car now moves forward (continuous motion effect)
- Obstacle cars (blue) spawn after random time intervals
- Coins rendered on the track
- Fuel icon added
- Background stays static while objects animate

Timing, randomness, and infinite-loop–based screen updates were implemented using RTC reads and controlled delays.
